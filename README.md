# speech-recognation-
Awesome! Let's break this down into the key parts: system design, code, and a working demo. Here's a solid starting point for your speech recognition system using an embedded board like Raspberry Pi or ESP32.

System Design

Objective: Recognize voice commands like "turn on light", "turn off fan", etc., and control connected devices accordingly.

Components:
- Embedded board: Raspberry Pi (for Python-based voice recognition) or ESP32 (with TensorFlow Lite/Edge Impulse)
- Microphone: USB mic or analog mic with ADC
- Output Devices: LEDs, relays, or motors
- Software: 
  - Speech recognition: `speech_recognition` library (for Raspberry Pi) or custom keyword spotting model (for ESP32)
  - GPIO control: `RPi.GPIO` or `machine` module

Architecture:
1. User speaks into the mic.
2. Audio is processed and converted to text or command keyword.
3. Command is matched against a predefined list.
4. Appropriate GPIO signal is sent to control the device.

Code Example (for Raspberry Pi with Python)

```python
import speech_recognition as sr
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

# GPIO setup
LED_PIN = 18
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(LED_PIN, GPIO.OUT)

# Speech recognizer setup
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
mic = sr.Microphone()

commands = {
    "turn on light": lambda: GPIO.output(LED_PIN, GPIO.HIGH),
    "turn off light": lambda: GPIO.output(LED_PIN, GPIO.LOW),
}

print("Say a command...")

while True:
    with mic as source:
        recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)
        audio = recognizer.listen(source)

    try:
        speech_text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio).lower()
        print("You said:", speech_text)

        if speech_text in commands:
            commands[speech_text]()
            print(f"Executed command: {speech_text}")
        else:
            print("Unknown command")

    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Sorry, could not understand audio.")
    except sr.RequestError as e:
        print(f"Request failed; {e}")
```

 Demo Tips

For a working demo:
- Show the board powering up.
- Speak clear commands and show the corresponding device action (e.g., LED turns on).
- Optionally, display recognized text on a small screen or terminal.
